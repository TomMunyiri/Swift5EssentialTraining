 # Basic Swift Classes

 ## Topic Essentials
 Even though swift has an entire library of built-in classes and structs for us to use in our applications, weâ€™ll still need to know how to create our own. These data structures can have properties, methods, initializers, and in the case of classes can have their own subclasses.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Create a simple class called **Adventurer**
 + Declare instance properties with or without values
 + Define designated and convenience initializers
 + Understand reference type behavior

// Declaring a new class

class Adventurer{
    var name : String
    var maxHealth: Int
    var specialMove:String?
    init(name:String,maxHP:Int){
        self.name = name
        self.maxHealth = maxHP
    }
    
    convenience init(name:String){
        self.init(name: name,maxHP: 99)
    }
    
    func initStats() {
        print("Character: \(self.name), Max Health: \(self.maxHealth)")
    }
    
}

var player1 = Adventurer(name: "Harrison", maxHP: 100)
var player2 = Adventurer(name:"Tommy")

player1.initStats()
player2.initStats()

var defaultPlayer = player1

defaultPlayer.name = "Mwangi"

player1.initStats()
